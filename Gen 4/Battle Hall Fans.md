The Battle Hall in Pokémon Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver has special fans that cheer you on if you meet certain criteria.

## Celebrity Fans

Major NPCs can show up in the Battle Hall to cheer you on. Unlocking these fans requires meeting specific total win streak benchmarks. Total win streak means the combined highest win streaks of all Pokémon. For example, if your highest win streak with Garchomp is 100, and your highest win streak with Bulbasaur is 20, you have a total win streak of 120.

These are the benchmarks required for Pokémon Platinum:

|NPC|Total Win Streak|
|---|---|
|Dawn or Lucas|500|
|Johanna (Mom)|1000|
|Professor Oak or Jasmine|10000|

These are the benchmarks required for Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver:

|NPC|Total Win Streak|
|---|---|
|Lyra or Ethan|500|
|Mom|1000|
|Professor Oak or Whitney|10000|

These NPC’s have a 30% chance to spawn once per day once you achieve at least a 500 total win streak. The function that generates this NPC runs upon successfully getting a ten win streak at the Battle Hall. Upon leaving, you have a 30% chance to spawn the NPC. If no NPC shows up, you can either try again by getting another win streak or just resetting the game, as the function will run upon loading the save that happens when exiting the hall.

Once an NPC does appear, you cannot get another NPC until the next day. If you pass the 30% check, the game then decides which NPC shows up. Every unlocked NPC has an equal chance to appear. This means that if you’ve only unlocked the professor’s assistant (the opposite of your player character) and your Mom, they each have a 50% chance of appearing. If you’ve unlocked all NPC’s, each NPC has a 25% chance of appearing.

## Serena and Winston

You also have an NPC fan that is always present in the lobby. If you are playing as Ethan or Lucas, your fan is Serena. If you are playing as Lyra or Dawn, your fan is Winston. By hitting specific benchmarks for the amount of Pokémon with any records in the Battle Hall, you can unlock additional dialogue for them. New dialogue unlocks at 1, 11, 31, 51, 101, 151, 251, 351, and 475 unique Pokémon with records. Your fan also moves closer to the entry point at 11 records and at 101 records.
