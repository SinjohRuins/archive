U-Turn has multiple glitches associated with it in the Generation 4 Pokémon games.
## Choice Glitch
The Choice Glitch is exclusive to Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Battle Revolution. This glitch occurs when a Pokémon uses U-Turn to switch into another Pokémon that is holding a Choice item and knows the move U-Turn. When this happens, the Pokémon that swapped in will be locked into using U-Turn until it swaps out.
## Flinch Glitch
The Flinch Glitch exists in every Generation 4 Pokémon game. This glitch occurs when a Pokémon uses U-Turn to switch into another Pokémon that is holding either a King's Rock or Razor Fang. When this happens, the opponent has a 10% chance to flinch, even if the attacking Pokémon was not holding one of these flinching items.

The game checks for King's Rock or Razor Fang after the swap occurs. This means that if a Pokémon holds one of these items and uses U-Turn to swap into another Pokémon, it will never flinch the opponent, unless the new Pokémon is also holding one of the flinch items.
