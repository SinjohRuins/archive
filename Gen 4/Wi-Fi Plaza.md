The Wi-Fi Plaza is accessible in Pokémon Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver by going downstairs in any Pokémon center. Official Nintendo DS Wi-Fi servers shutdown in 2014, but the Wi-Fi plaza can still be accessed in-game via the [Poké Classic Network](https://pkmnclassic.net).
# VIP Feature

VIP, or Special Guest, is a status given to select players in the Wi-Fi Plaza. When a player that has VIP status enters the plaza, the news board updates saying that a very special guest has arrived. There’s no way to visually identify these special guests without approaching them. VIPs have a unique gold trainer card that appears on the bottom screen. VIPs also always start with a level 3 tap toy.

VIPs also have a password feature that can be enabled by the server. If this feature is enabled, the VIP's trainer card will show 4 passwords (localized as slogans). These slogans are derived from the game's [easy chat system](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Easy_chat_system), and are determined by data sent from the server.
## Daisuki Club Event
Shortly after Pokémon Platinum's Japanese release, the Pokémon Daisuki Club held a Wi-Fi Plaza event. Between 1 and 8 PM every day from October 27th to October 31st 2008, Daisuki Club Staff members would be in the plaza. By approaching the staff members, you can get their password. By entering this password and trainer name of the staff member into the Daisuki Club website, you would be entered into a lottery, where 20 winners would be chosen to be given VIP status and an unknown gift. It is not known if this event resolved properly. If any players did receive VIP status, they no longer had it by the time the servers shutdown. As far as we know, no events utilizing the VIP feature took place afterwards.
# Footprint Boards
Within the Wi-Fi Plaza, players can interact with two footprint boards. These footprint boards allow up to eight players to simultaneously place stamps of their Pokémon's footprints.
## Arceus Footprint

The Wi-Fi Plaza features a flag that censors Arceus' footprint. This flag is sent from the server. If the flag is on, Arceus’ footprint is visible, both on its stamp and on the board. If the flag is off, the Wi-Fi symbol shows instead. The flag only works properly in non-Japanese releases of HeartGold and SoulSilver; it will always show the Wi-Fi symbol in all other Generation 4 releases. There is no evidence of this flag ever being turned on, and packet dumps captured near the end of official Nintendo DS Wi-Fi support showed the flag set to off.
## Footprint Stamp Color
The color of a Pokémon's footprint stamp is determined by calculating the Pokémon's PID mod 9.

| PID mod 9 | Color (White Board) | Color (Black Board) |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0         | Black               | White               |
| 1         | Red                 | Magenta             |
| 2         | Green               | Lime                |
| 3         | Blue                | Light Blue          |
| 4         | Orange              | Yellow              |
| 5         | Purple              | Lavender            |
| 6         | Brown               | Beige               |
| 7         | Teal                | Navy Blue           |
| 8         | Dark Gray           | Gray                |
