# Encounter Rate
The base fishing encounter rate in Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire is 49. This is true regardless of rod used or location. This rate is stored in the game's data as 50, but is programmatically reduced by one due to an error.

Several modifiers can be applied to the base fishing encounter rate. If the console's time is currently set to Morning (6AM - 10:59AM) or Evening (6PM - 8:59PM), then 20 is added to the fishing encounter rate. If the fishing bob lands near a non-surfable tile, meaning a tile that you cannot surf on under any circumstances, then you receive an additional increase of 20 for each of these surrounding tiles. This can stack three times, one for each cardinal direction from the bob ignoring the direction that faces the player.

Below are some examples for tiles that provide this bonus if your fishing bob is adjacent to them:

| Land                         | ![[land.png]]   | ![[land2.png]]   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Walkable tiles next to water | ![[puddle.png]] | ![[puddle2.png]] |
| Rocks                        | ![[rock.png]]   | ![[rock2.png]]   |
| Walls                        | ![[wall.png]]   | ![[wall2.png]]   |
| Other                        | ![[bridge.png]] |                  |


If the lead Pokémon has the Suction Cups or Sticky Hold ability, the base rate is multiplied by 2. If the fishing encounter rate exceeds 100, it is set to 100 and you are guaranteed a fishing encounter.
# Chain Fishing
Chain Fishing is a mechanic unique to the Generation 6 Pokémon games. By landing fishing encounters consecutively, you can drastically increase your odds of encountering a shiny Pokémon. Every time you land a fishing encounter, your chain increases by one. Your chain is reset to zero if you fail a fishing attempt. Failing a fishing attempt means you reeled it in too slowly or quickly, or nothing bit.

Chain Fishing can be done while at any location where you can fish. You can knockout, flee, or catch Pokémon encountered while fishing and your chain will still persist. Encountering or catching shiny Pokémon does not break your chain. You can also move freely in your current location once you start a chain.

The only ways to break a streak are to fail a fishing attempt, reload the game, or trigger an area transition. Area transitions are denoted by black wipes that pop up when you enter specific areas or Fly somewhere. These transitions force the game to reload map data which stores your fishing chain. If there is no black screen when you change location, your chain is still intact.
