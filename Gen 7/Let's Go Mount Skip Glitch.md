By riding Rapidash or Aerodactyl, the Mount Skip Glitch in _Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!_ and _Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!_ allows you to move past a trainer’s vision and skip battling them.

Rapidash and Aerodactyl are the only ride Pokémon in the game that can move at a maximum speed of 26 units per frame. Trainer vision _or_ the player character’s hitbox—it is still unknown which one—is 25.28 units wide. As such, the resulting 0.72 unit window opens the opportunity to skip past trainers. These windows occur at an interval of 26 units.

We utilize wiggling, the act of performing sharp 180-degree turns by buffering the directional input in the menu, to position ourselves. By doing so, we can consistently move a set amount of units in any direction. For example, if our character is facing up, we can access the menu, hold down, and close the menu; as a result, we will move a few units either left or right.

Below are some wiggling reference numbers:

|Ride Pokémon|Units Moved While Wiggling|
|---|---|
|None|9.8158|
|Rapidash|2.9472|
|Starmie|2.3027|
Below are working Rapidash mount skip starting positions for the required Victory Road trainer battles (assuming [these controllers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JFYR6W6) are used and you start unmounted):

|Trainer|Position|
|---|---|
|Naomi|x: 1626.7389|
|Nelson|y: 2229.2209|
|Colby|y: 1829.2214|
|Dawson|x: 14029.2217|
